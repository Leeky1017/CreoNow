# Notes — ISSUE-54

## Goal

- Audit P0 completion status.
- Complete P1-001..P1-005 task cards.

## Findings

- P0 task cards in `openspec/specs/creonow-v1-workbench/task_cards/p0/` have several `Status: pending` but corresponding PRs are merged and E2E coverage exists; update cards to reflect reality.

## Decisions

- Keep P1 proxy default-off and deterministic error semantics; avoid relying on real network in E2E.

## Later

- Investigate missing `design/Variant/DESIGN_SPEC.md` reference (path mentioned in repo governance but file not present).
