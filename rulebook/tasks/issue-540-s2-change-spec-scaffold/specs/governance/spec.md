# Governance Task Spec — issue-540-s2-change-spec-scaffold

## Scope

Deliver Sprint 2 change bootstrap under OpenSpec + Rulebook + GitHub governance:

- Create 27 active `s2-*` change folders with `proposal.md` + `tasks.md` + `specs/*-delta.md`
- Preserve S0/S1 doc structure and dependency-sync wording
- Attach anti-regression labels in every proposal to prevent recurrence of known issues from `docs/代码问题/`
- Update `openspec/changes/EXECUTION_ORDER.md` with Sprint 2 wave/dependency ordering

## Acceptance

- Every Sprint 2 change in `docs/plans/unified-roadmap.md` has a corresponding active change directory.
- Every proposal contains explicit `防治标签` and actionable pitfall reminders.
- Every `tasks.md` follows the fixed TDD 6-section order.
- `openspec/changes/EXECUTION_ORDER.md` includes all active Sprint 2 changes and their dependencies.
